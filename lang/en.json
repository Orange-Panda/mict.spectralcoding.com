		"PARAGRAPH_0_0": "Long ago when the world was young there were 4 Gods. Each tasked to do their part in shaping the world. Working together with each other they sought to maintain the balance the world needed. As time went on, so did the complexity in their positions grew. Small quarrels turned to arguments, arguments turned to hate and not too soon after war was on the horizon. And so they went their separate ways.",
		"PARAGRAPH_0_1": "With hostility growing between the Gods so did their ignorance towards the rest not wanting to partake in the war. Malcs, the leader of the lesser dragons at that time begins devising a plan. While not as strong as the Gods they knew something had to be done.",
		"PARAGRAPH_0_2": "Recognizing that they could not defeat them they could instead seal them. Willingly they would sacrifice themselves in the process of creating a powerful seal under their leader. But it took a huge toll. Almost all perish in the end to complete the seal, but it works, with Malcs now a saviour in the eyes of others. Knowing that if he were defeated it would mean the end. And so he leaves in grief, exiling himself for an eternity.",
		"PARAGRAPH_0_3": "In the long centuries that pass so does the creep of age affect Malcs, a long time has passed. One day adventurers unknowingly discover his location. Not knowing who he was, Malcs was treated like another trophy to get, and so he was targeted. Countless adventurers from all over took up this opportunity and so he fought, for years...until he no longer could. The seals break and in doing so 4 beacons of light strike up towards the sky with a vicious roar: Radiant Silver, Soft Blue, Mossy Green and Burning Red.",
		"PARAGRAPH_0_4": "Rumors of mysterious colossal dungeons appearing at the origins of these light start to spread. The Gods prepare for their return. With you at the centre of this now, what will you do?",
		"TITLE_1": "Aeris - The Air God",
		"PARAGRAPH_1_0": "Radiant Silver, wings of bountiful colors. Aeris is known as the Loving God. Given the power of flight she travelled the world radiating her love and beauty towards all the populace of Melvor. In the eyes of the people she was a beacon of hope and a symbol of peace in which the gods upheld. When trouble arose she would always be there as if a guardian was always watching over. During the early times she would often meet with the other gods to discuss the role she would play, however she considered only one a good friend. Over the many years that had passed her tireless effort had left her exhausted. \"It's always the same.\" she cried. With all her effort she truly believed she was doing good. But the world is cruel and ever changing. Was she really ever needed? she thought. Upset and no longer wanting to feel this way she decides to exact the opposite of what she stood for. And so in the end the once loving god of Melvor becomes the recluse. Leaving the people to fend for themselves. \"I wonder, what does all this power amount to when its no longer there, what do the people do when the hero leaves?\"",
		"TITLE_2": "Glacia - The Water God",
		"PARAGRAPH_2_0": "Soft Blue, a cold heart. Glacia is known as the Helping God. While managing the oceans and seas she would guide lost voyagers who had gone astray to safety. The explorers of Melvor called her the Ocean's Spirit, for when she was happy the oceans were calm and when she was not the waves echoed it. The role she played was not something she wanted to do, but she knew it was her duty to maintain. Her true dream was to be free above the clouds like Aeris. Being tied to the oceans it was the only thing that was ever on her mind. However the burden of not being able to lied deep within her heart. Despite knowing she was shackled she would still try time and time again but fail. To always see Aeris soar away after their meeting was enough to break her. And as time went by her growing bitterness towards her role eventually escalated to hatred when Aeris decided she would no longer fulfil her role anymore. Having clung to this dream for so long and seeing someone squander it was outrageous to her. And so they argued and argued for even longer until only what was left was nothing but pain behind her eyes. And after all these years it had already consumed her inner self. \"Do you pity those who use their power for everyone else knowing they can never help themselves? they are the ones who tread the line between a blessing and curse.\"",
		"TITLE_3": "Terran - The Earth God",
		"PARAGRAPH_3_0": "Mossy Green, careless wisdom. Terran is known as the Entrusted god. The Earth God was the first before the others. With his power he transformed most of the worlds landmass to how it is seen today. All but one of the other gods respected him as their elder, knowing full well he would be the most knowledgeable. And so being unrestricted he was allowed to do whatever he wanted. The early inhabitants of Melvor saw him as the greatest of all which gave him all the support he needed to further continue his work. Terran would also organize the meetings of gods and instruct them of the role they should be upholding. But since the other gods never questioned him his ignorance towards everyone grew in parallel with his arrogance. As time went by to him there were no more boundaries, which in turn led to the anger of the other gods. But it had been so long, he did so much so what was different for him now? And so in his mind he was so sure he was betrayed when he was confined to a place where he no longer had any influence. \"Solitary, confined to my own darkness. The whispers of a thousand cries brush over me like the wind. Is this true torture? Maybe not. This is the beginning of a new true king.\"",
		"TITLE_4": "Ragnar - The Fire God",
		"PARAGRAPH_4_0": "Burning Red, a demonic ego. Ragnar is known as the Chaotic god. The Fire God was the youngest of all the gods. With the power of fire he stood above the rest in terms of strength and he knew. His fierce rivalries with the other gods and his lack of emotion towards everyone else was troublesome. Knowing this the other gods shunned him and for the benefit of all living creatures he was restrained to a lesser influence by Terran. Ragnar was treated like an outcast and for a god to be shackled to this kind of level was demeaning. Ragnar despised Terran but he also knew he was not yet strong enough to take on all three of them and so he decides to start scheming in the background. Through his subordinates he would start to spread rumors which led to hate and violence amongst the people. His targeted actions were ruthless and lingered for years. Knowing full well who would eventually be blamed for this, Terran. And so with the growing hostilities between the gods and the inevitability of war on the horizon the restraints that once held him back turned feeble. The others will remember why he was known as the strongest. \"Patience is the key to everything, the weak seek to find their opportunity while the strong know when it is their time again.\"",
		"TITLE_5": "The First Hero and an Unknown Evil",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_0": "Despite the unbalance the Fall of the Gods would bring upon the land, it was a necessary evil. They were once shapers of the world, tasked with creating everything inside of it, and building upon their creations to give them life and complexity. Over the years, rising discourse and anger over how to lead and create gave way to disputes and wars with immeasurable casualties. The Fall of the Gods has brought forth a time of celebration and healing, along with some much-needed rest for you, who has slumbered away peacefully since the Gods’ defeat.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_1": "The Capital of Melvor has been a place of peace and jubilant festivities, with hardly an idle hour in the streets since the heroes returned. Joyous laughter and elaborate parties continued while a sinister threat gathered on the horizon, unseen by all.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_2": "You finally rouse from your slumber and depart from the simple, yet cozy tavern you had stayed in for the past few days. Wiping the sleep from your eyes, you ponder at the sudden, eerie stillness Melvor has been plunged into overnight. A blanket of thick, onyx mist chokes the sky with ghostly tendrils of an inky black substance weaving in and out of windows, doorframes, and the like. Despite your peering into shops and scouring the streets, there wasn’t a person in sight, with stalls, games, and food left suddenly and without apparent reason.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_3": "You continue on, headed towards the main gates of the Capital. The closer you get to those looming gates, the more people you could see gathered all around, seemingly frozen in place in front of the wide-open gateway. You call out, yet no noise can be heard from your throat. You try to run but find yourself unable to. It feels as if ice has clawed its way into your body, leaving you raw and cold. After trudging along slowly for what feels like hours, the citizens are within reach, each with twisted expressions of horror and fear, looking out past the gates.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_4": "You push through the silent crowd and follow their gaze to the horizon, locking your eyes upon a ruined tower in the distance. The windows and cracks of the pillar seep black mist, which continues to pour out at a frightening pace despite the seemingly frozen state of everything else. You reach out towards the tower and see your hand quickly become engulfed. Your feet follow quickly after, despite repeated attempts to kick the substance away. The mist locks you in place and creeps up your body, pulling you into the ground. It floods into your mouth, filling your lungs as you try to cry out. Things become so... incredibly cold. Every bit of heat is sapped from your body, leaving a bitter chill that freezes you to your core. Despite your struggles, it quickly consumes you, pulling you into the frozen earth.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_5": "With a sudden snap, light flickers back, and the cold recedes from your body, almost as quickly as it had come. Despite feeling warm, you still feel… tainted. Sick, in a way. You look around and see a high vaulted ceiling and dark cobbled stone. Starlight filters into the room, illuminating great illustrations of gold-clad warriors and an ancient throne. Four smaller thrones are dotted throughout the room, though they currently sit empty and seemingly have for ages. From the main throne, you hear a hearty chuckle, followed by a couple of short, raspy coughs.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_6": "“It’s been awhile since a Vorloran has managed to make their way into my tower. I presume you came to strike me down, no?”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_7": "You begin to speak, but a sputtering cough rattles out instead as remnants of dark mist are expelled from your lungs. “Who are you?” You croak.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_8": "“I am a being far beyond your comprehension. Simply put, I may be your undoing, though time is yet to tell. As it currently stands though, it simply doesn’t matter who I am.”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_9": "You move to draw your weapon but are quickly restrained by black mist that floods into the room. “There’s no need for that. One shouldn’t enter a home and threaten the owner. They could quickly find themselves… incapacitated.” A sick, toothy grin creeps across the being’s face. The cloaked figure shakes their head and continues. “Defeating the Gods was impressive, but your true test still lays ahead. The girl must be stopped.”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_10": "The cloaked figure extends an open palm towards you. “Now, begone.” You hear them quietly whisper, “Ret Nni Iwm Ete Ami Its Lu The” before they close their hand. You blink, and find yourself far, far from Melvor. People rush past you, nearly knocking you over. Time seems to have returned to normal.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_11": "“What’s going on? Where are you all off to?” You ask a staring passerby.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_12": "“It’s all over. Grab what you can and run as far as possible. Do not let the mist catch you.” They quickly take off, random bits and belongings tumbling out of their arms as they run along.",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_13": "Confused, you approach a woman, huddled into a corner and heavily sobbing. “She’s gone! We’re all doomed! There’s no hope left!”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_14": "“Who is it? Who’s gone?”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_15": "“Ahrenia… our hero. She ventured into the mist… and never returned.”",
		"PARAGRAPH_5_16": "You back up, even more confused. As your situation settles in, mist starts to trickle over the eastern wall of the city as a crowd frantically runs by. A thought creeps into your mind. Is this… truly the end?",
		"TITLE_6": "New Dawn",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_0": "The Vorlorans were a race of people who gladly worshipped the Gods and spread their influence across the land with fervor. Setting up shrines and churches, gathering offerings, and spreading word of the Gods were commonplace. In return, the Gods blessed harvests, summoned rains to extinguish fires, and granted strength to those in need. Things continued like this for many years with little complaint from either side.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_1": "The people elected a special group of holy warriors, which they named The Warriors of Vorloran. This group was tasked to root out and kill any evil creatures that rose throughout the land of Melvor, cutting out rot and darkness across the land. Among the Warriors of Vorloran rose a leader, named Ahrenia. She happily accepted the role of commander and led the warriors well, quickly rising to fame throughout the land for her good deeds and skill in combat.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_2": "As the war between The Gods began their sudden disappearance had left the Warriors of Vorloran to fend for themselves in their fight against evil. Their weapons and armor no longer carried their blessings that once protected them and with it their dependence on the gods had now left them vulnerable. Unease began to sweep through the ranks, fearing an unstoppable evil would eventually arrive. Their fears would then become a reality as rumours began to spread of a dangerous mist approaching.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_3": "The Mist, said to have appeared out of the blue, was already destroying the outer towns of Melvor. The Mist seemingly was able to take control over monsters, leaving an affliction that would turn them into a murderous undead horde, led by a Dark Entity in which the survivors named Bane. With the Warriors of Vorloran weakened they hopelessly tried to protect as many people as they could, and one by one… they fell to its afflicted army. Ahrenia, desperate to do anything she could to save her people, traveled to the meeting place of the Gods known as the Millenium Tower, located in the Vorloran capital. Within the tower no gods greeted her. Only a cloaked figure who called themselves “The Herald”. They offered her the power she needed to save her people, and, though hesitant, she accepted.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_4": "Though the mist had destroyed many towns and cities, there was still much to save, and Ahrenia rushed back to do as much as she could. With their hero returned to them, many celebrated and gathered arms, ready to fight back against the dark entity with renewed vigor. They marched off with songs in their heart, with Ahrenia leading them. All too soon, they reached Bane’s army and met the entity face to face. With a cry, Ahrenia charged forward, her blade glowing brightly and the Warriors of Vorloran all behind her. Her mastery of the combat arts shone in the battlefield, as fast as light her blade tore through all that tried to attack her, switching effortlessly to her to bow to help out the people around her and using magic to wipe out hundreds in a blink of an eye. Her men followed closely behind trying to keep her safe so she could focus on leading and casting. Her men frequently cried out in pain, others in fury, desperately fighting the unending hordes.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_5": "Soon enough, Ahrenia met face to face with Bane, who tried desperately to drive her back with torrents of magic. She pressed on, landing clean blows against Bane who struck back with equal force. With both suffering substantial damage, Ahrenia gathered her strength and pointed her sword towards the sky. A ray of golden light poured down from the heavens, driving the mist back. The normally silent Bane screeched out with a blood-curdling cry, “Herald! I have failed you!” Ahrenia faltered, hearing the name of The Herald, but believing in her strength she aimed it towards Bane. Just as the edge of the golden light pierced Bane’s rotten, fetid flesh… it stopped. As did she. She looked around in horror as the mist quickly cascaded back all around her, swallowing her men and blotting out the sun. She tried to scream out, but no words came. The last thing she saw was a cloaked figure approaching her.",
		"PARAGRAPH_6_6": "Now with what little power she has left she offers it to you, “Vorloran, you must find a way to stop the Herald at all costs, search the lands and oceans for anything that will help you, you are our final hope now.”"
