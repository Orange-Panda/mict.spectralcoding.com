# Contributing Guide

First, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Glad you want to help.

## Getting Started With Local Development

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository, which creates a copy in your GitHub account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your newly forked repository to your local machine.
3. View your local website by opening `index.html`. You can also start a portable webserver using Python (`python3 -m http.server`).

## Code Standards

Nothing super specific, follow what is already out there. Generally we're already using the best practices and accepted coding standards of the different technologies used. Do what you think is best and we'll review and address issues during a pull request.

## Submitting Changes

Submit changes via a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your forked repository to the `develop` (or `tooling` if appropriate) branch on this repository.

## Licensing

Any merged code will fall under the project license (GNU General Public License, Version 3) whose full text can be found in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.
